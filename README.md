#Ice Cream Revenue Prediction using Simple Linear Regression Model
This repository contains a simple linear regression model built to predict ice cream revenue using the IceCreamData.csv dataset. The model is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook file (Ice_Cream_Revenue_Prediction_using_Simple_Linear_Regression_Model.ipynb), which includes the Python code and necessary explanations.

##Introduction
Predicting ice cream revenue can be valuable for ice cream vendors and businesses to optimize their production, pricing, and marketing strategies. This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of a simple linear regression model to predict ice cream revenue based on certain features provided in the dataset.

##Features
The dataset (IceCreamData.csv) contains the following features:
Temperature: Temperature in Celsius
Revenue: Ice cream revenue in dollars

##Prerequisites
To run the Jupyter Notebook and execute the code, you need to have the following installed:
Python (version 3.6 or higher)
Jupyter Notebook

##Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   https://github.com/ishikasadhwani/Revenue-Prediction-using-Simple-Linear-Regression
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd ice-cream-revenue-prediction
3. Install the required Python dependencies:
   pip install pandas NumPy scikit-learn
   
##Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (Ice_Cream_Revenue_Prediction_using_Simple_Linear_Regression_Model.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Execute the code cells sequentially to load the dataset, train the model, and make predictions.
3. Analyze the results and predictions made by the model.
